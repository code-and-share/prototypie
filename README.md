# prototypie
A simple HTML interface between two datasets that are then linked by a simple ML application

A simple web app that asks a user five questions with 2-4 possible answers each. The answers are recorded into a training dataset. After submitting the answers, the user will be prompted with 3-4 suggested results from a predefined "proposals" dataset. In the training phase, the user is then asked to rank these proposals according to her personal preference. This feedback is then used to train the actual algorithm to find meaningful proposals according to the answers each user gives in the questionnaire. 

We will start the protopye with 5 questions, 2-4 answers each and about 20 results.
